Implementation of DoRA

Below is the specific method from the dora paper:
This analysis examines the updates in
both magnitude and direction of the LoRA and FT weights
relative to the pre-trained weights to reveal the fundamental
differences in the learning behaviors of both. The weight
decomposition of W ∈ Rdxk can be formulated as:
 W =m x V / ||V ||c = ||W||c x W / ||W||c

where m ∈ R1xk is the magnitude vector, V ∈ Rdxk is the
directional matrix, with ||·||c being the vector-wise norm of
a matrix across each column. This decomposition ensures
that each column of V/||V ||c remains a unit vector, and the
corresponding scalar in m defines the magnitude of each
vector.
